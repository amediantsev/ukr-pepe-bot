Btw, this README was generated by the ChatGPT.

This project is a Telegram bot that listens to messages in a group chat, triggers an action when specific conditions are met (e.g., 5 messages sent within the last minute), and generates responses using the GPT API.
Features

Monitors group chat messages in real-time using Telegram Bot API webhooks
Triggers an action when 5 messages are sent within the last minute or when a message starts with a specific word
Generates dynamic bot responses using the GPT API from OpenAI
Serverless architecture using AWS API Gateway, AWS Lambda, and AWS DynamoDB

### Prerequisites

Rust programming language installed
An AWS account with access to API Gateway, Lambda, and DynamoDB services
An OpenAI API key

### Setup

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Create a new bot on Telegram by talking to the BotFather and getting your API token.
Set up an AWS API Gateway to handle incoming webhook requests from Telegram.
Create an AWS Lambda function using the provided Rust code and integrate it with the API Gateway.
In the Lambda function, update the code with your Telegram Bot API token and OpenAI API key.
Deploy the Lambda function and obtain its public HTTPS URL.
Register your webhook with Telegram by sending a setWebhook request, providing your public HTTPS URL.
Create a DynamoDB table to store the messages and set a TTL (Time to Live) attribute for automatic expiration.

### Usage

Add your bot to a Telegram group chat.
The bot will monitor the group chat messages and trigger an action based on the specified conditions.
